# Test Post With Link [rss bugfix]
<!-- %TIMESTAMP=1729785229% -->

A [relative link](/posts/my_new_SSG_and_blog.html) to another post for RSS
generation testing.

Don't mind me, just fixing a bug in [poogo](https://github.com/trevarj/poogo)
(my static site generator) and giving it a test. Relative links, ex. to other
posts, were working on the web, but broken on RSS.
