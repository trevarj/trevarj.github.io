<p>I had a half-joke where I would tell people that all I did at a previous job was
write if-else statements to fix every problem that came up. There are two
reasons why I evolved into the if-else programmer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ideas and creativity were ignored. Anything a developer offered to improve the
code was rejected and deemed as not needed by management. The value was only
found in things that instantly settled client demands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes all you can do with fragile, legacy, test-less (good luck
refactoring), spaghetti code is add +meatballs+ if-statements to check for
null or some condition that was found on a production system and needed a
hotfix. You'll be faced with no choice but to fix every problem with
band-aids.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if I was closing a bunch of tickets, it was mind-numbing and made me not
enjoy programming, which resulted in my skills stagnating during the workday and
then fading away since I didn't program in my free time.</p>
<p>It was easy for me to get into this situation and then held hostage by a nice
paycheck and various psychological reasons. Minus the dire circumstances, I
believe it is a good time to move on when you become an if-else programmer
instead of risking your skills and falling behind for a (temporary) job.</p>
