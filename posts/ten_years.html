<p>This year will mark my tenth year working as a professional software engineer.
Lately, I have been contemplating on my experience and my next steps and goals
that I would like to achieve as a programmer. I also want to be sure that I
don't fall into the same traps as I did before.</p>
<p>#This post is intended as notes for my future-self.# Hopefully this will help
me organize my thoughts on what to do in the next ten years.</p>

<p>After ten years, I hoped that I would be a bit more advanced with programming
and not a general application developer. I regret not using my young buck energy
and brain to learn a specific domain or pursue a master's degree to study a
topic deeply. I've always been fascinated by advanced CS/programming topics like
compilers and operating systems, but have had trouble self-learning them. This
makes me wonder if I even have a strong enough passion for programming and
computer science to go beyond application development.</p>

<p>I am extremely grateful to be a programmer during this time period, getting into
the industry when jobs are aplenty, and earning more than enough to live a very
comfortable life. Being able to work from anywhere, at any time of the day is a
luxury that almost all professions lack.</p>
<p>I wish someone told me ten years ago that most of professional programming, and
maybe software in general nowadays, kind of sucks and you will most likely be
working on a product that you don't use or isn't yours and that will turn into a
disgusting mess due to business people getting their hands involved in
technology and prioritizing profits and timelines over anything else.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Side Projects</h2><a id="user-content-side-projects" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Side Projects" href="#side-projects"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>These are computer-related things that I pursued and will continue to pursue outside
of work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributing to and writing open source software</li>
<li>Daily driving Unix-like operating systems and configuring them for fun</li>
<li>Learned Rust, Haskell, Idris, and tinkered with other various languages</li>
<li>Participating in IRC to learn and help others</li>
<li>Refining my development environment and workflow</li>
<li>Tinkering, writing simple programs, tools, and games</li>
<li>Trying to brush up on and learn other CS topics</li>
</ul>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Goals</h2><a id="user-content-goals" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Goals" href="#goals"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
