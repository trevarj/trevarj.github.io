<p>This past weekend (starting on a Thursday) I decided to scrap my Arch install
and install <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64" rel="nofollow">Gentoo</a>. I suppose you
could say I fell for <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/install-gentoo" rel="nofollow">the old 4chan
meme</a>.</p>

<p>Arch has probably been the best distro I've experienced. I don't really need to
explain all its benefits since they have all been answered elsewhere online. For
me it was a great balance between customization, productivity and minimalism.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Why not $DISTRO_NAME?</h2><a id="user-content-why-not-distro_name" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Why not $DISTRO_NAME?" href="#why-not-distro_name"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://systemcrafters.net" rel="nofollow">System Crafter's IRC</a> channel, when
everyone was discussing distros to try or ones that they use, I began
contemplating (again) what my perfect distro would be.</p>
<p>The answer that I always land on is not Gentoo -- it's a BSD. After some time
experimenting with FreeBSD, I really enjoyed the ecosystem and documentation
that they had. It does come with a few quirks that I can't come to terms with,
like having to use Linux emulation for some programs. It always seems possible
to use it full-time but then a program sneaks up on you that only works under
Linux. Perhaps once my Nvidia hardware dies then I will try out FreeBSD or
OpenBSD again.</p>
<p>So, for GNU/Linux distributions, it came down to Artix vs Void vs Gentoo.
Switching to Artix, something I've done before, would be trivial.</p>
<p>I spent a day looking into Void and experimenting in a VM, but I didn't really
find it to be any better than Arch/Artix or have something beneficial that it
could sell me. Unless the system has something drastically different to
offer, like Nix/Guix (and I don't need extreme reproducibility), then it just seems
not worth the time investment.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Gentoo Linux</h2><a id="user-content-gentoo-linux" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Gentoo Linux" href="#gentoo-linux"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Gentoo seems to tick a lot of boxes for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Control</li>
<li>[x] Customizability</li>
<li>[x] Ability to be minimalist (sometimes forced, if you don't want to compile!)</li>
<li>[x] Large, knowledgeable community to learn from (forum, IRC)</li>
<li>[x] Great documentation (handbook, wiki)</li>
</ul>
<p>At first, I was intimidated and irritated at the complexity, but the more I read
the more I was convinced this is a great distro. Things started to make sense
and I was actually learning and re-learning more about a GNU/Linux system under
the hood.</p>
<p>It only took me a couple days (without full attention) to get up and running
back to where I was with Arch. I utilized a few binary packages for large,
compile intensive programs, like Firefox and a kernel.</p>
<p>Compiling everything might deter a lot of people, but for me it is a way to be
conscious of what I am installing and how to maintain a system that isn't full
of random packages. If I see that the dependency list of a package is much too
large, I'll reconsider using that package and look for an alternative. It was
annoying when I wanted to install <code>shellcheck</code> and saw how many Haskell
dependencies it uses. I ended up installing the binary for it, which I was
thankful existed.</p>
<p>I still need some time to adjust to the utilities for maintaining a Gentoo
system, so I can't really speak about much more yet.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Will I Hop Again?</h2><a id="user-content-will-i-hop-again" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Will I Hop Again?" href="#will-i-hop-again"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Like a lot of people, I tend to go through tech phases. Eventually, I may just
get tired of compiling stuff, especially if the time comes when I don't have a
separate PC for work and have to quickly install some tools to be productive.</p>
<p>As I said before, I'd still like to try to work towards daily driving a BSD.
There is also the possibility of looking for an even more hardcore Linux distro
like LFS in order to really learn a system in and out. I could even take a
completely different direction and install Debian and then manually compile
fresh versions of programs that I frequently use.</p>
