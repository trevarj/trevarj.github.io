<p>At the end of 2023 I got antsy. I was finally going to do it...again. I was
about to venture on leaving <a href="https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim">LazyVim</a> and
create my own Neovim config from scratch using lazy.nvim with inspiration and
knowledge that I gathered from LazyVim (the greatest Neovim distro to date).</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">My Vim Journey</h2><a id="user-content-my-vim-journey" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: My Vim Journey" href="#my-vim-journey"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>My first exposure to vi/vim was after I installed Linux and needed to edit
files in the terminal, much like how other people probably find it. I don't
exactly remember if Ubuntu (my first distro) had Nano enabled as the default
editor back then, so I think I may have been forced to learn how to edit using
vi.</p>
<p>I slowly became comfortable editing files using Vim and even doing a little C
programming with it, but barely scratching the surface of the editor's power.</p>
<p>Once I got into Linux ricing, I saw that people had really cool looking Vim
configurations. I wanted to make mine look like that too, but I wasn't really
interested in using the editor for more than editing system files quickly.</p>
<p>Some time went by and I was finally sick of GUI editors being memory hogs and
slow. I went down the road of trying to configure Vim as a full-fledged IDE
using CoC and other great plugins from Tpope. I used that for a bit, but
couldn't really dive into using it permanently at work. It was still fun to
mess with in my free time.</p>
<p>One day I heard about Neovim and how it was supposedly <em>blazingly fast</em> with
LuaJIT and a faster development cycle. I installed and went down the road of
migrating over to a Lua-based config. It was early in the plugin days, so
things were really rough unless you had your ear to the ground and were already
a Vim/Lua wiz. I was not, so I got a bit overwhelmed.</p>
<p>This is about the time that I found out about Neovim distributions. It was a
relief from the anxiety of having to maintain my own configuration...or at
least I thought. Now instead of having to fix a plugin issue, I had to fix a
distro issue, wait for a fix to get pushed upstream, or disable a plugin that
they had added. After using my own config again for a bit, I settled on
AstroNvim, which was a pleasure to use at my job for a while.</p>
<p>Then lazy.nvim was released - a neovim package manager that was supposed to end
the problem of breaking configurations. Shortly after, lazy.nvim's creator and
Lua plugin warrior, <a href="https://github.com/folke">Folke</a> created LazyVim, a distro
that utilizes lazy.nvim. I immediately installed it and replaced AstroNvim. I
had been using it full-time up until about a week ago.</p>
<p>I began to get a bit frustrated again with using a distro after I got hit with
a few breaking changes, since I cannot resist updating all the plugins whenever
I see there are updates available. Things would break at the beginning of a
workday and I was too stubborn to rollback, so I neurotically would start
fixing editor issues instead of working.</p>
<p><em>Secretly switched to <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">Doom Emacs</a> for a
bit</em></p>
<p>I came to the realization that I had no idea what was going on with my editor
anymore. I already forgot most of the stuff I learned from doing a custom
config last time (probably never learned it and copy pasted too much). It was
time to buckle down and start over.</p>

<p>I made a list of the things that I truly needed to be productive in my editor:</p>
<ul>
<li>time</li>
<li>LSP</li>
<li>autocompletion</li>
<li>formatting</li>
<li>treesitter</li>
<li>statusbar</li>
<li>git integration</li>
<li>file tree</li>
<li>keybindings</li>
<li>all plugins and options that I curated using LazyVim</li>
</ul>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Config Creation Workflow</h3><a id="user-content-config-creation-workflow" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Config Creation Workflow" href="#config-creation-workflow"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>In my opinion, getting keybindings, LSP and autocompletion working are the main
steps to a productive configuration. Basically, I started by reading
lazy.nvim's docs and hitting each of the requirements above, reading through
the docs of the plugins and sifting through Github discussions and issues when
I ran into a problem. Like I said, a lot of my config is taken from LazyVim,
because I believe it does the bulk of things in the ideal way. I spent a lot of
time reading through the LazyVim source code, then deciding if I needed to
extract certain things or could do it myself in a simpler way. I wanted to stay
minimalist so that when I read the configuration months down the
line I understand what is going on.</p>
<p>After that it is the grind of reading plugin docs and figuring out what you
need configured - a daunting task for newcomers and those who don't have the
time or patience to read docs.</p>
<p>I will still be following LazyVim's development because it has become somewhat
of a source of truth and the community is still active (even though as I write
this the project hasn't had a push for two months...)</p>
