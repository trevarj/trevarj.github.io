<p>Let's just say I've been evangelized as a Bitcoin maximalist. Instead of
redacting my previous <a href="./Quick_Thought_on_Cryptocurrency_Technology.html">thoughts on the crypto
industry</a>, I will read
through and respond to myself from one year ago. A bit of self-reflection, if you
don't mind.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>I will state that I am not anti-crypto, per se, but I am anti-whatever I am
about to describe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am now anti-crypto, but pro-Bitcoin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think crypto can provide a useful utility for people,
namely transferring funds elecronically without an intermediary (kinda).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now believe that Bitcoin is a very useful utility, namely one that gives
people the chance to control their own wealth and transact without the
interference from a government or bad actor. Beware the money printer and
war-machine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I think the world would be worse without crypto? Not really.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For some people, possibly. Even a shitcoin, like the one that is widely used in
South America (forgot the name and don't want to promote it either) could be
making peoples' lives much better by helping them store dollars while their
local currency is extremely volatile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am content with Bitcoin and Ethereum, but beyond those I have not actually
found a coin that offers "life-improving" technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After spending a lot of time reading up on Bitcoin history, I believe it to be a
tech and open source phenomenon, similar to Linux, which can definitely improve
a person's sovereignty. It's organic growth in the beginning is fascinating,
just like Linux's, and is something to read about even if you aren't invested or
interested in the technology.</p>
<p>Ethereum is just the most popular scam platform. Perhaps useful at this current
time, but not providing anything with real longevity and is bound to be
replaced. Bitcoin cannot be replaced because of its organic and decentralized
nature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am going to completely generalize here, so take it with a grain of salt. Keep
in mind that I am a "nothing-to-show" dev who hasn't created such "successful"
projects before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still valid!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After reading through and working with many crypto projects, there are
practically none that seem impressive anymore. They are either poorly
documented, hastily written, over-engineered or just faulty. Rarely do they
promise something life-changing or revolutionary, no matter how much they hype
it up on social media. With confidence I can say that the majority of them are
just purely copy-pasted code and ideas that add one extra feature in hopes of
securing a voluptuous cash grab.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still valid.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's gotten to the point where it's laughable to me when a new crypto project
appears and it's just a fork of Ethereum or some other code with a few changes
added and a shiny, new website with some marketing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are all scams under the surface. Even if they are not blatant rugpulls,
they are long term scams which work within rules and regulations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I think of all the code written for these projects and man-hours
wasted. It's comical, actually, especially since the code is just re-written
over and over or just abandonware at the end! This may be an issue with the
software industry as a whole, but it's amplified here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still believe this and I see it to be true even in Bitcoin. Everyone is
obsessed with technology, coding and making more disposable fluff
projects. There is a certain type of dev that cannot sit still or "complete" a
project. Everything must be rewritten or modified continuously without a clear
end goal. LLMs have contributed to this, allowing a dev to write even more slop to
"advance" a project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compare these types of projects with real engineering marvels, like a bridge
or a skyscraper, or even a missile launcher that will end up blowing up some
hospital far far away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the image of comparison still holds, but I still can't articulate it in
a poetic way. It's hard to make a value judgment on certain technology. Sadly,
the latter part of what I said is becoming more true as time goes on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money and Tech Obsession</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This section still stands true with me.</p>
