<p>This year I completed <a href="https://adventofcode.com" rel="nofollow">AoC</a> using Emacs Lisp. I would
say that this year was a more legitimate completion than last, since I used less
hints and reference solutions. Here is <a href="https://github.com/trevarj/advent-of-code/tree/master/2024">a
link</a> to my
solutions. Sorry that they are uncommented and probably incomprehensible. Also
<a href="https://github.com/trevarj/emacs.d/blob/master/lisp/aoc.el">a link</a> to my AoC
helper package which allowed me to read problems, fetch inputs and submit
answers, all within Emacs.</p>
<p>Using Elisp was much more comfortable for me than using Haskell and OCaml (my
previously used languages for AoC). It was a real pleasure to have an instant
feedback loop using Emacs itself as a REPL, instead of Haskell and OCaml's
clunky REPL experience. The REPL is important for these types of problems if you
have a small brain like me and can't use your imagination to render data
manipulation pipelines.</p>
<p>The libraries I used were fantastic;
<a href="https://github.com/magnars/dash.el">dash.el</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/magnars/s.el">s.el</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/Wilfred/ht.el">ht.el</a> should be built-in to Elisp. I do
regret not exploring seq.el (built-in) enough, because it does seem to be very
useful since it works generically over any type of sequence (lists, vectors,
etc).</p>
<p>My only issues were that Emacs completely locks up when running a long
computation. A few problems I left running for minutes, and one overnight. Maybe
this is actually charming, since I woke up to a correct answer as if it was
Christmas morning. I also was a little dissatisfied with iteration in some
cases. I spent a lot of time bikeshedding how I would do a simple loop -
<code>cl-loop</code>, <code>named-let</code>, <code>dotimes</code>, <code>while</code>, or just a recursive function.</p>
<p>Even though I am still not a Lisp expert, I reached my goal of being able to
whip up a script fairly quickly, and now will use Elisp as my "scratch"
programming language.</p>
<p>I really recommend Emacs users to try AoC in Elisp for the cozy experience and
low barrier for entry - just open up a buffer and start writing then <code>C-x C-e</code>.</p>
