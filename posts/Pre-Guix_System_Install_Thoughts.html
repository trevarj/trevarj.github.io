<p>Ok, listen. I said a few posts back that I wasn't going to distrohop again after
Gentoo, but I lied. I just purchased a new Stinkpad, and I am going to give GNU
Guix System a shot.</p>
<p>It's an AMD machine, so there should be no need for any Nvidia hassle. In my
mind, it will go smoothly!</p>
<p>I'm making a public statement to hold myself accountable -- I shall give Guix a
fair try, attempt to make some contributions (if they'll have me!), and enjoy
helping others in the community as a bit of a hobby that will live safely on its
own hardware.</p>
<p>If it's really really bad, then I will just install FreeBSD or Debian, as
promised.</p>
<p>OR....</p>
<p>Maybe I will just embrace doing computing "the olds cool" way and have
everything broken, start smoking cigarettes at the keyboard, and doing a bit of
online gambling!</p>
