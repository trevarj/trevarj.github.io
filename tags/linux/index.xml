Smashed the wifi card into the motherboard and that was the end of that install 2010 Ubuntu On Macbook. This is how I learned to program in a Linux environment 2012 Crunchbang Deleted Windows for a bit to learn Linux better 2013 Arch Started &amp;ldquo;ricing&amp;rdquo; on the Macbook 2019 Manjaro KDE + Linux Gaming (daily driving Linux) 2020 PopOS Searching for better desktop/Nvidia experience 2021-2024 Arch/Artix Using Ubuntu full-time at work Apr 2024 Gentoo Arch has probably been the best distro I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced.</description></item></channel></rss>
