I&amp;rsquo;m constantly intrigued by devs who are able to escape wage slave jobs and become self sufficient somehow, whether it is by starting a business (the old way) or the new ways of social media influencing or content creation. Creating a software company definitely seems to be much harder nowadays in software than it was, say, 10-15 years ago, and A LOT less enjoyable than the scenarios I present below.</description></item><item><title>My Return to a Custom Neovim Config</title><link>https://trevarj.github.io/posts/neovim_2024/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 11:37:32 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://trevarj.github.io/posts/neovim_2024/</guid><description>At the end of 2023 I got antsy. I was finally going to do it&amp;hellip;again. I was about to venture on leaving LazyVim and create my own Neovim config from scratch using lazy.nvim with inspiration and knowledge that I gathered from LazyVim (the greatest Neovim distro to date).
My Vim Journey My first exposure to vi/vim was after I installed Linux and needed to edit files in the terminal, much like how other people probably find it.</description></item><item><title>Late Start in Computer Programming</title><link>https://trevarj.github.io/posts/advice2noob/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 19:33:07 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://trevarj.github.io/posts/advice2noob/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving advice (sometimes unsolicited) to people who want to shift into computer programming as a career.
Being a late bloomer in programming is definitely manageable, but I believe it requires careful planning and a specific behavior.
Overview This has been beaten like a dead horse by #learn2code tweets and Youtube videos, but these are the main goals to become a general application programmer:
Learn the fundamentals of programming and the basics of how a computer works Learn one programming language and write programs in it Contribute to open source projects and/or have a personal project Behavior The most difficult undertaking and, what I think, is the most important factor for learning programming is the obsession needed to succeed.</description></item><item><title>Ten Years a Dev</title><link>https://trevarj.github.io/posts/ten_years/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trevarj.github.io/posts/ten_years/</guid><description>Introduction This year will mark my tenth year working as a professional software engineer. Lately, I have been contemplating on my experience and my next steps and goals that I would like to achieve as a programmer. I also want to be sure that I don&amp;#39;t fall into the same traps as I did before.
This post is intended as notes for my future-self. Hopefully this will help me organize my thoughts on what to do in the next ten years.</description></item><item><title>Mentorship</title><link>https://trevarj.github.io/posts/mentorship/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trevarj.github.io/posts/mentorship/</guid><description>The most valuable thing I got out of my first job was that I was being mentored by a senior guy - something I feel like will never come my way again unless someone is willing to mentor a doofus in his thirties with ten years of experience. He wasn&amp;#39;t a modern &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; engineer who has five years of experience either. He had about 30+ years of experience under his belt.</description></item></channel></rss>
