I've been interested in tech content creation recently and have been trying to
guess the future of this modern programming career path. I'm constantly
intrigued by devs who are able to escape wage slave jobs and become self
sufficient somehow, whether it is by starting a business (the old way) or the
new ways of social media influencing or content creation. Creating a software
company definitely seems to be much harder nowadays in software than it was,
say, 10-15 years ago, and A LOT less enjoyable than the scenarios I present
below.

Since Github is now a social media site where you can even [look up developers
by their popularity](https://github.com/trending/developers), is it possible
that this will become a future career path in programming, just as Youtuber
became a career path for acting/comedy/cook/whatever else?

## Scenarios

### 1. Open Source Guru
1. Be a [10X
   dev](https://www.quora.com/Where-did-the-myth-of-the-10x-software-developer-come-from)
or expert in some area
2. Create or contribute to useful projects project(s)
3. Market project (or have followers/contributors do it) on social media
4. Start writing blogs, streaming, and/or making videos about that content and
   more. Optional because these guys are good enough to just get picked up by a
top company.

### 2. Twitch Programmer
1. Be entertaining
2. Make tech videos or stream
3. Gather a following and sponsors
4. Create project on video or stream
5. Use following to boost project
6. Start selling stuff

These scenarios could lead to the opportunity of quitting your day job and
starting to earn an income from donations or sponsorships (GH, Patreon, etc). It
seems like a nerdy version of a beauty blogger teaching how to put on makeup and
then pushing a cosmetic line...or an artist who streams painting and then sells
their works to viewers ...or even a battle worn veteran who tells war stories of
how he killed a bunch of really bad dudes and then starts a coffee company or
something...I don't know!

## Influence

I'm not entirely sure how I feel about the influence these content creators have
on young programmers. I have certain opinions about the format in which the
content is delivered. For example, if done incorrectly, a stream can be a huge
waste of time for the viewer, even if it is entertaining. Maybe no one wants to
admit that though and would stay that the engagement factor is important for
learning. 

Will young programmers want to just become a tech influencer instead of putting
in the time working a terrible office job at least once like the rest of us? My
guess is not on a large scale like with regular social media, since programmers
tend to keep to themselves and be less outgoing.

Another thing that I think about is how these tech influencers are...influencers
in the sense that they can be idolized, which in turn can make product (courses,
merch, promo codes, etc) sales predatory, similar to what it's like on non-tech
social media.

## A Realistic Scenario

Obviously, the first and second scenarios are not exactly probable or possible
for everyone to do.

I speculate that the third scenario can become more mainstream in the future, at
least for a seasoned developer (10+ years, or 10Xer) who prefers to not be in
the death grip of a software company. I suppose this scenario is analogous to
being a contractor and accepting a grant to work on an open source project that
you like, but with the addition of having individuals as supplemental
sponsorships. Basically, you're working on something you're passionate about and
people throw money at you for it.

## Tech Influencer Network

A tech influencer from Scenario 1 or 2 builds his brand and decides to convert
into an organization. Other devs are hired and work on the org's projects, and
they can even champion their own projects and get marketed through the main
influencer's clout. You can see this in a lot of popular podcast networks and
other Youtuber channels. I'm pretty sure this already exists among tech
streamers, but I haven't looked into it much. It seems like it could be a nice
boost to open source development. I could be completely wrong though and someone
would point out all the reasons why this is a bad business model.

I don't know what the heck I'm talking about.
