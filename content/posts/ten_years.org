* Introduction
This year will mark my tenth year working as a professional software engineer.
Lately, I have been contemplating on my experience and my next steps and goals
that I would like to achieve as a programmer. I also want to be sure that I
don't fall into the same traps as I did before.

*This post is intended as notes for my future-self.* Hopefully this will help
me organize my thoughts on what to do in the next ten years.

* First Job (Spring 2013)
** Positives
- Had a mentor
- Exposed to low level programming
- Learned about GNU/Linux for ARM, custom SBCs
- R&D experience
- Fun coworkers

** Negatives
- Project stagnated
- Didn't write enough C or learn as much about hardware as I should have
- Long commute
- Left job early for Java money and short commute

** Reasons for Joining
- Recommended by a professor from university
- Interested in low-level programming and hardware

** Reasons for Leaving
- Bored and felt like I couldn't learn more from the job
- Commute was annoying
- Others were thinking about leaving and one guy already left

* Second Job (Summer 2014)
** Positives
- Became comfortable in large, legacy codebase
- Experienced full-stack for a while
- Lots of debugging and learned to hunt bugs
- Multiple salary increases
- Went full-remote (pre-C*vid, remote hipster)
- Fun coworkers
- Five minutes from home and personal freedom

** Negatives
- Got stuck in legacy code Java 8 hell
- Didn't focus on career growth enough
- Stayed way too long

** Reasons for Joining
- Bought into the mission
- Seemed like there was room for growth
- Close to home

** Reasons for Leaving
- Corporate takeover consequences (relocate or take pay cut)
- Tired of Java 8, legacy code and product
- Felt like my programming skills were atrophying
- Agile is so annoying and never done well

* Third Job (Fall 2020)
!! Will update later !!
** Positives
- Fully Rust codebase
- New project when I joined
- Great teammates
** Negatives
-
** Reasons for Joining
- Wanted to program Rust full-time
- Interested in the company's industry

** Reasons for Leaving
N/A

* Conclusions
After ten years, I hoped that I would be a bit more advanced with programming
and not a general application developer. I regret not using my young buck energy
and brain to learn a specific domain or pursue a master's degree to study a
topic deeply. I've always been fascinated by advanced CS/programming topics like
compilers and operating systems, but have had trouble self-learning them. This
makes me wonder if I even have a strong enough passion for programming and
computer science to go beyond application development.

** Bipolar Statements
I am extremely grateful to be a programmer during this time period, getting into
the industry when jobs are aplenty, and earning more than enough to live a very
comfortable life. Being able to work from anywhere, at any time of the day is a
luxury that almost all professions lack.

I wish someone told me ten years ago that most of professional programming, and
maybe software in general nowadays, kind of sucks and you will most likely be
working on a product that you don't use or isn't yours and that will turn into a
disgusting mess due to business people getting their hands involved in
technology and prioritizing profits and timelines over anything else.

* Side Projects
These are computer-related things that I pursued and will continue to pursue outside
of work:
- Contributing to and writing open source software
- Daily driving Unix-like operating systems and configuring them for fun
- Learned Rust, Haskell, Idris, and tinkered with other various languages
- Participating in IRC to learn and help others
- Refining my development environment and workflow
- Tinkering, writing simple programs, tools, and games
- Trying to brush up on and learn other CS topics

* Goals
The following are goals that I would like to achieve in the next ten years.
| years | goal                                                                          |
| <= 2  | Write more C; at a job or more personal projects.                             |
| <= 5  | Do a project for OS dev; write a shell, bootloader, Forth, etc.               |
| <= 5  | Make code contributions to a large open source project - a feature or bugfix. |
| <= 5  | Do a project with an embedded device.                                         |
| <= 5  | Reduce time spent on the computer in freetime.                                |
| <= 5  | Find job in specialized field instead of app dev.                             |
| <= 10 | Get paid to work on open source software full time.                           |
| <= 10 | Be self-employed.                                                             |
