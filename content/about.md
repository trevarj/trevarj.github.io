I have 10 years of professional development experience (as of 2023).

My technological interests include: FOSS, Linux, Unix tools / philosophy, various
programming languages, text editors, tinkering.

Favorite programming languages:
1. C (best overall)
2. Rust (best strongly typed)
3. Haskell (best purely functional)

Current technical aspirations:
1. Make a commit to a Unix-like operating system
2. Work full-time on open source software
