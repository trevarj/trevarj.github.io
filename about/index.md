# About me

<img src="/static/profile.png" width=200>

I have 11 years of professional development experience (as of 2024).

My technological interests include: FOSS, Linux, Unix tools / philosophy, various
programming languages, text editors, tinkering.

I am hoping to, one day, work full-time on open source software, or at least on
a project that is open source.
